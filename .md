  ## Overview

Readme Magic is a command-line tool that simplifies creating **`README.md`** files for your projects. It uses interactive prompts to collect project information and generates a comprehensive README document.

## Implementation Details

### Features

- Interactive CLI prompts to gather project information.
- Supports dynamic generation of project features, images, and dependency badges.
- Generates a README with sections like Overview, Features, Installation, and more
- Automatically detects project dependencies from **`package.json`**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (or yarn)

### Global Installation

1. Install Readme Magician globally using npm. This makes the **`readme-magic`** command available system-wide.

npm install -g readme-magic
```

### Using Readme Wizard

After installation, you can run Readme Magic from any directory on your system.

- To start the interactive prompt and create a README, type:

```sh
readme-magic
```

- Follow the interactive prompt to input your project details
- Upon completion, Readme Magic will generate a **`README.md`** file in your specified directory

### Updating

To update Readme Magic to the latest version, run :

```sh
npm update -g readme-magic
```

### Uninstalling

If you wish to uninstall Readme Magic, use:

```sh
npm uninstall -g readme-magic
```

## API Reference

#### `promptUser()`

This is the primary function that initiates the interactive prompts for the user.

- **Functionality**: It prompts the user to input various details about their project such as project name, author, features, dependencies, etc.
- **Returns**: Promise that resolves to an object of type **`ReadmeData`**

#### `generateReadme(template: string, data: ReadmeData): string`

This function compiles the user input data with a Handlebars template to generate the README content.

- ** Parameters**:
  - **`template`**: A string representing the Handlebars template for README.
  - **`data`**: An object of type ReadmeData containing user-provided details.
- **Returns**: A string that is the compiled README content

#### `ReadmeData` Interface

This TypeScript interface represents the structure of data collected from the user.

- **Fields**:
  - **`projectName` (string)**: The name of the user's project. It's used as the title of the README.
  - **`email` (string)**: The email address of the author of the project, use for contact badge in the README.
  - **`githubUrl` (string)**: The URL of the project's Github repository. This is included to provide users with a link to the source code.
  - **`linkedin` (string)**: Linkedin name prfile of the author of the project, use for contact badge in the README.
  - **`description` (string)**: A brief description of the project, outlining its purpose and key features.
  - **`features` (array of strings)**: A list of notable features of the project. Each feature is listed as a bullet point in the README.
  - **`wantImage` (array of strings)**: URLs of images the user wants to include in the README. These are displayed as embedded images in the document.
  - **`dependencyBadges` (array of strings)**: Badges representing the project's dependencies, typically used for visual representation in the README.
  - **`dependencyNames` (array of strings)**: The names of the project's dependencies. These might be used to provide detailed information about each dependency.
  - **`directory` (string)**: The directory path of the project, which can be used to provide cloning and setup instructions.
  - **`license` (string)**: The type of license under which the project is released, displayed in the README.
  - **`author` (string)**: The name of the project author or maintainer.

#### `getDependenciesInfo()`

This function extracts dependency information from the project's **`package.json`**.

- **Returns**: An object containing arrays of **`dependencyNames`** and **`dependencyBadges`**.

#### Main Function

- Orchestrates the workflow: prompts user, gets dependencies info, and generates README.

## Interactive Prompts

The **`promptUser()`** function uses inquirer to ask the user a series of questions. Here's an overview:

- **Project Name**: "What is the name of your project?"
- **Email**: "What is your email?"
- **Linkedin**: "What is your LinkedIn?"
- **Github Url**: "What is the URL of your repo?"
- **Description**: "Please enter a description of your project: "
- **Package Manager**: "Select a package manager: "
- **Directory**: "What is the directory of your project?"
- **Author**: "Who is the author of your project?"
- **Want Images**: "Do you want to include images?" - ""Please enter an image URL"
- **Features**: "Please enter a feature of your project "

Each prompt corresponds to a field in the **`ReadmeData`** object. The responses are used to populate this object, which is then utilized by **`generateReadme`** to create the README file.
